# This takes multiple RRD files, and produces XML for a single RRD
# that is a merge of the specified files.  It will try to correct and change
# intervals where required, and approximate data with the best available fill.
# Multiple DS will be consolodated and merged, and can be renamed if
# required. !!!!ALWAYS TAKE A BACKUP OF DATA FIRST!!!!
#
# This is intended to be used for merging a set of old-style MRTG/RRD archives
# to make a single new extended-RRA RRD file to work with extendedtime=full
# in Routers2.
# Example (when in WorkDir):
#   cp target.rrd target.rrd.old
#   rrdmerge.pl -R -o target -r 12000 target.rrd archive/*/target.rrd.d/*.rrd
#
# Usage:
# rrdmerge.pl [-q][-R][-a|-D ds[=ds] ...][-o output[.xml|.rrd]][-r rows]
#             [-i sec]
#             base.rrd [rrd1.rrd rrd2.rrd .... ]

Add these lines or similar to all your cfg files in the future so that RRD
files are created with extended length:

RRDRowCount[_]:   12000
RRDRowCount30m[_]: 9000
RRDRowCount2h[_]:  8000
RRDRowCount1d[_]:  1600

Finally, stop the rrd-archive.pl scheduled job, and set extendedtime=full in
your routers2.conf
